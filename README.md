### Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Raphael, I'm a developer from Germany and I'm currently mostly working with ✨ web technology. ✨\
[Since I host most of my code by myself][explore], this profile is primarily used to wreak havoc on other people's open source projects.

For example:

-   Changed the look of the message bubbles in Conversations, https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/pull/1280
-   Added Unix socket support to Caddy, then fixed a bug with it, https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/467 & https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/699
-   Fixed a typo because it was breaking my company's test reporting, https://github.com/gkushang/cucumber-html-reporter/pull/191
-   Broke `mongomock`'s pipeline by adding support for `$objectToArray`, https://github.com/mongomock/mongomock/pull/723

If you like Minecraft like I do, have a look at https://github.com/eiszfuchs/lo-rez and its editor. It could use some attention.
